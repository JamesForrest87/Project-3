# Project-3
Exploring the Star Wars Universe through Data Analysis

Group 4 members: Khalid Naji, Eyasu Yilma, Nicholas Lym, James Forrest 

Introduction:
Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to the exploration of the Star Wars universe through data analysis. In this project, we leverage CSV files containing various datasets related to Star Wars and store them in an SQLite database for efficient data management and analysis. Our aim is to delve into the rich lore and vast expanse of the Star Wars galaxy, uncovering fascinating insights and patterns through rigorous data analysis.

Data Sources:
The primary data sources for this project include CSV files obtained from reputable sources such as the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and other relevant data repositories. These CSV files contain a wide range of information, including character details, film-specific data, starship specifications, and more.

SQLite Database:
To facilitate efficient data access and analysis, we have organized the collected data into an SQLite database. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database engine ideal for handling small to medium-sized datasets. The use of SQLite allows for seamless integration with various programming languages and data analysis tools, enabling smooth exploration and manipulation of the Star Wars data.

Project Structure:
Data: This directory contains the CSV files obtained from various sources, including SWAPI and other relevant datasets.
Scripts: Here, you will find scripts for importing data from CSV files into the SQLite database. These scripts automate the process of creating tables, importing data, and ensuring data integrity.
Queries: This directory houses SQL queries for performing various analyses on the Star Wars dataset stored in the SQLite database.
Visualizations: Contains code and files for generating visualizations based on the analyzed data. Visualizations may include charts, graphs, and other graphical representations of insights derived from the data.

Getting Started:
To get started with exploring the Star Wars dataset and conducting data analysis:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the scripts directory and run the provided scripts to import the data into an SQLite database.
Explore the queries directory to find SQL queries for analyzing the data according to different themes or questions of interest.
Utilize the visualizations directory to generate visual representations of the analyzed data using your preferred data visualization tools or libraries
